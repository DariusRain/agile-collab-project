# /public (Front-End)

<!-- 
When changes are made in this directory write about it in here.

<!-- 
This directory will contain all the static files that will be used only on the front-end/Browser.
The only type of files that should be in this directory are .css .js and .html files, also images if you want. 
This Directory links to the 'server.js' file you should see the code 'server.use(express.static("public"))'
and that is what causes the server to be able to access this directory and use the files within it in the browser
